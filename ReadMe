This is a similar application as original application being developed in our organization which I'm currently working in this.
while working on this application I was made to work only on java,Servlets so I didn't get the chance to work on front end, then I've developed this using Bootstrap v2.2.2 framework as to learn
BootStrap, javascript, Jquery, etc...

But Still need to work on web responsive I.e Layouts in different device like Mobile, Tablets etc..

Project Description:

We have developed a System to Chit Fund Company. In this Application admin, Chit Management Agent and group of people are the main roles. In this system group of people 
and duration of the chit then agent divide or calculate amount which every member has pay for each month according to Chit duration and commission for the agent. The main 
process is every month agent will conduct auction, the member who bid more amount he’ll get remaining amount of total amount in that month then that member won’t allow for 
further auction. Then unbidden amount will be distributed among all member with agent commission except bidden member, like this continuous until chit duration. The Main 
purpose is the member who need money urgent he has to bid more and get money.
